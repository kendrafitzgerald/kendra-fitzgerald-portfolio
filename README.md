## Description

I built this website to serve as a professional portfolio of my coding work. I wanted to showcase the HTML and CSS skills I have learned as well as create a touchpoint for future projects I complete. I was motivated to do so because as a developer, it is important to have a website that holds all of your work for potential employees to be able to reference. This website solves the problem of having a singular place where all of my current and future coding projects can be easily accessed. I learned how to utilize advanced CSS to create an aesthically pleasing website that is functional on multiple viewports. I also learned how to adopt a growth mindset as parts of this project were frustrating. By working through each issue I was able to overcome my frustrations and formulate a professional portfolio.

## Usage

There are multiple ways to use this website. If you click on the links "About Me", "Work", and "Contact Me" in the navigation bar, you will be taken to the corresponding sections on the webpage. You are also able to scroll down the webpage to navigate the varying sections. If you click on the link "Resume" in the navigation bar, you will be redirected to my LinkedIn profile to view my current resume. In the "Work" section of my portfolio, each image is linked to a project I have completed, and you will be taken to the corresponding site upon clicking the image. The main image corresponds to the accessibility updates I did on the Horiseon site. The four smaller images lead to my current GitHub profile but will soon redirect each image to a completed project. In the "Contact Me" section of the webpage, each link corresponds to a different way to reach me. If you click on the number, you will be able to call my cell phone. If you click on my email, you will be able to email me to connect. The GitHub and LinkedIn links will take you to each of my portfolios for those sites, respectively. Finally, my website is able to be used on devices with viewports larger and smaller than 992px.
