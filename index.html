        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Kendra Fitzgerald and I am on the path to becoming a Full-Stack developer.
            I graduated from Tulane University in 2022 and am currently enrolled in the University of 
            Pennsylvania's Coding Bootcamp. I am 
             
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about helping others and hope to use the skills I learn in bootcamp to create 
            transformative solutions to problems. I am a problem solver at heart who uses both logic and 
            abstract thinking to break apart various types of puzzles-and put them back together again! I
            would love to connect with individuals to collaborate on projects of all kinds. 
            View my work linked below, and do not hesitate to reach out to me!
        </p>
